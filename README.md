## Official Swirlds

First see [Official "SDK"](http://www.swirlds.com/download/) which is the official Swirlds "SDK". Includes the swirlds.jar and a number of sample Applications.

* [lbaird/swirlds-demos](https://github.com/lbaird/swirlds-demos) - sample applications demonstrating specific functions of the the Hashgraph platform. Official SDK is required to run.

## Development Tools

### IDEs

* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/oxygen1a) - most popular IDE for Java. Some integration with the SDK.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) - best looking IDE for Java.

## Reference Hashgraph projects

* [Babble](https://github.com/babbleio/babble) A hashgraph-implementation in Go. Currently works for private networks.
* [EVM-babble](https://github.com/babbleio/evm-babble) A babble wrapper for the Ethereum virtual machine to run solidity smart contracts backed by hashgraph.

## Other Resources

* [Exo Application Framework](https://github.com/craigdrabiktxmq/exo) Exo is an open-source framework for building applications on top of the Swirlds SDK.  Exo provides an easy way to receive transaction from applications via Java sockets or REST, a framework for organizing your business logic and transaction processing, and a mechanism for logging transactions to a blockchain data structure.
** [Exo Zoo Demo](https://github.com/craigdrabiktxmq/exo-demo) A demonstration application that shows an AngularJS application communicating with a hashgraph via REST and Java sockets.
